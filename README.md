# Platzi App Clone For Android ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾
Hi Stranger! this is the plazi clon app, I created this project based on the oficial Platzi app and tried to recreate it by myself.

## The app contains

- DI with Dagger Hilt
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM
- Testing with Mockk
- Data binding 
- Navigation
- Live Data
- Connection with firebase to get the data through APIs

## The Creation Process

I began this app from scratch, I first took some screenshots of the official app and began to analyze the components from each layout that I was going to create.

After that I began to think about what design pattern I was going to use, I chose the MVVM because is the recommended design pattern by Google and it gives me the possibility to reutilize code and use coroutines in a more comfortable way.

For the dependency injection I chose Dagger Hilt because I'm more familiar with it than with koin.

The funniest part of creating this project was using the firebase real time database because I'm familiarized with consume APIs but I don't create the APIs often. For this project I populated the data in the firebase database and got the json that the app would consume. The app gets the information of the achievements, lessons, paths and podcasts from here:

And the Json looks like this:

To manage the video in the app, I used the Youtube Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player?hl=es) and for the podcast section I used the default media player of Android. In the beginning I was getting the podcasts from firebase but I reached the quota and I had to use local files.
